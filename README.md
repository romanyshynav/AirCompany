## How to work with project?
 Step by step:
   - Clone project from GIT-repository to your computer.
   - Create in MySQL local database named `"db_airPlane"` and connect it to project.
   - In file `"application.yml"` set-up database credential (username, password) for your local MySQL.
   - We use `"Flyway"` to create Entity-tables and fill database with information.
   - We can use both `"Swagger"` and `"Postman"` to test endpoints from task-list. Swagger provides more confort.
